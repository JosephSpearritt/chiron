# Project Chiron

Project for the 2016 Tanda hackathon.

Intended to allow employees to text a phone number to register as sick. 

A medical specialist can view requests, can call the sick employee,
confirm if they are sick or not, and update the payroll/rosters
accordingly via Tanda's API.

## Usage
The application can be run by using the `manage.py` file.

```
    $ python manage.py run_debug
```
